# 📌Microservice Project — Event Manager with Java + Spring Boot & AWS

## 📝 Project Description

The project consists of an independent microservice — ms-event-manager — organized in a monorepo to facilitate development and maintenance.

- **Microservice Event (Port 8080):** Responsible for registering, updating and consulting events, integrating with the ViaCEP API for address validation, ensuring security via JWT and Persistence made with MongoDB Atlas via Spring Data MongoDB.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project uses a monorepo to facilitate the management and development.
Its internal structure was developed following the Spring Boot layering pattern, with a clear separation of responsibilities.

The main folder structure is organized as follows:

```
ms-event-manager/                  # Microservice responsible for event management (port 8080)
├── src/main/java
│   └── com/anamariafelix/ms_event_manager
│       ├── client/                # OpenFeign interfaces for consuming external APIs (e.g., ViaCep and ms-ticket)
│       ├── config/                # Global Settings (Security and Swagger)
│       ├── controller/            # REST controllers that expose endpoints to the end client
│       ├── dto/                   # Data Transfer Objects (Create and Response DTOs)
│       ├── enums/                 # Enumerations used in the system (e.g., Status, types, etc.)
│       ├── exception/             # Custom exception classes
│       ├── jwt/                   # JWT authentication implementation (provider, filter, UserDetailsService)
│       ├── mapper/                # Converters between entities and DTOs
│       ├── model/                 # Domain entities (e.g. Event, User)
│       ├── repository/            # Data access interfaces (Spring Data JPA/Mongo)
│       ├── service/               # Services with business logic

└── pom.xml                        # Maven configuration file

## 🧩 Tool and Dependency Details

### 🔗 OpenFeign

- **In ms-event-manager:**
  - Exposes REST endpoints that are consumed by ms-ticket-manager as if they were local methods, simplifying integration logic.
  - `ViaCepClient` Consumes the ViaCEP external API via ViaCepClient to obtain address data based on the provided zip code, also with configured timeouts, fallback, and logging.


### 🔒 Spring Security & JWT

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User sends credentials to `POST api/v1/auth`.
2. The JWT token is generated if authentication is valid.
3. The token is returned to the client.

**Authorization Flow:**
1. Client sends the token in the header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
2. A filter validates the token and populates the security context.

# 🚀 Deploy and Use the Application on AWS EC2

## Deploy na AWS EC2
- The application was deployed in the cloud using an AWS EC2 instance configured with Java 17 and associated with an Elastic IP to ensure stable access.
- The deployment was done directly from the .jar file generated by the project and executed on the instance.
- The application does not have a visual home page, being accessed exclusively via API endpoints by tools such as Postman or Swagger UI.

### Base URL
Url that must be passed in requests to endpoints

http:///3.150.5.82:8080
  
### Endpoint Examples
| Méthod | Route                         | Description           |
| ------ | ------------------------------| ----------------------|
| POST   |`/api/v1/auth`                 | Authentication        | 
| POST   |`/api/v1/events/create-event`  | Create event          |
| GET    |`/api/v1/events/get-all-events`| List all events       |

### Example of a request via Postman:
GET http:///3.150.5.82:8080/api/v1/events/get-all-events
